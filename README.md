# repulsive_curves_implementation
This is an implementation of the paper ”Repulsive Curves” (2020) by Chris Yu, Henrik Schumacher, and Keenan Crane (https://doi.org/10.48550/ARXIV.2006.07859). I implemented it with the application of embedding non-planar graphs in 3D in mind.

The project is in the zip file. There is a PDF titled "README" in the zip file including build instructions and a detailed description of every aspect of the project.
